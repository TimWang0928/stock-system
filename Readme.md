Inventory Management System

This project is a warehouse management system built on Django and MySQL, providing functional modules such as product inventory management, user authority management, and multi-warehouse management.

1. Product classification and labeling
Supports multi-level classification management, and products can be classified into different categories.
The label system supports fast search and statistics.
The classification adopts a tree structure to facilitate hierarchical management.
2. Multi-warehouse management
Supports independent inventory management of multiple warehouses.
Products can be transferred between different warehouses.
The inventory data of each warehouse is maintained separately.
3. Inventory alarm
Supports setting upper and lower limits for inventory.
When the inventory is lower or higher than the threshold, the system will trigger an alarm.
The alarm information can be viewed through logs or notifications.
4. Inbound/outbound records
Automatically record each inbound and outbound operation.
The record includes product name, quantity, operation time, person in charge, and remarks.
Supports viewing historical inventory changes through operation logs.

More features are under development.
